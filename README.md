# Phenix AI

This repository owns the generic Phenix runtime, conductor, internal client wire, independently packaged first-party plugins and protocol adapters, and the supported Harness product.

The Neovim frontend lives in `matthis-k/phenix-nvim`. This repository owns server-side behavior and frontend-neutral contracts.

`phenix-core` owns plugin identity and lifecycle, deterministic service resolution, authority attenuation, generic persistence, events, tasks, and embedded, external, and resource-only hosting. It does not own session, context, execution, planning, tool, model, frontend, or other first-party agent semantics.

`phenix-conductor` owns the generic server process and client transport. It hosts only configured plugins. A zero-plugin conductor has no first-party fallback behavior.

First-party `phenix-plugin-*` and `phenix-adapter-*` crates own independently selectable runtime behavior through the same core contracts available to alternate providers. A thin `phenix-plugin-catalog` collects embedded factories but owns no durable state or product policy.

`phenix-harness` owns the supported product assembly. It selects plugins, grants authority, chooses persistence, loads product configuration and skills, and exposes the wrapped `phenix` product.

`phenix-client` owns the internal conductor client/server wire; it is not a public Client SDK. `phenix-adapter-acp` is the transport-independent ACP runtime plugin. Its package and runtime identity exist, while standard ACP dispatch remains unimplemented.

### Rust boundaries

| Crate or package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `phenix-core` | Generic plugin host, trust boundaries, persistence enforcement, events, tasks |
| `phenix-client` | Internal conductor client/server wire |
| `phenix-conductor` | Generic configured server and transport |
| `phenix-plugin-*` | Independently owned first-party services |
| `phenix-adapter-acp` | Stateless ACP adapter runtime plugin |
| `phenix-plugin-catalog` | Thin embedded-factory catalog |
| `phenix-harness` | Supported conductor + selected-plugin product assembly |
| `phenix-backend-*` | Provider/backend adapters |

## Product composition

The normal `phenix` package is the supported Harness composition. It is built through the same public package interfaces available to users.

Nix exposes independently packaged first-party runtime plugins, including adapters, through `phenixPlugins.<system>.*`. `wrappers.phenix.wrap` and `lib.mkPhenix` assemble a conductor with an explicit plugin selection. Omitting a plugin removes its service unless another selected provider supplies the same contract.

The resolved component graph is the canonical runtime composition for component imports and event listeners. A `ComponentExport` identifies the executable endpoint. It does not need a duplicate terminal `ServiceContribution`. Plugin service contributions remain available for ordinary service dispatch and explicit interposition layers. Embedded and external hosts execute the same graph-selected component identity. Development reconciliation replaces kernel configuration, component graph, listener bindings, resources, and generation as one resolved runtime topology.

Plugin-owned durable state is canonical. Core enforces namespace ownership, migrations, transactions, and authority without interpreting first-party domain rows. Process-local handles, connections, caches, and provider generations are disposable and must not become durable identity.

### Product configuration and skills

Supported runtime configuration lives in `config/phenix/runtime.nix`. Skills and product resources live under `config/phenix/skills/`.

The Harness packages these resources and loads agent definitions, orchestration definitions, and routing profiles through plugin-owned services. Product configuration does not become hidden conductor policy.

Project context and skills are context-plugin resources. Their metadata never expands execution authority. Script or workspace access still uses ordinary service authority.

## Packages

The flake exposes:

- `packages.<system>.phenix-core`;
- `packages.<system>.phenix-client`;
- `packages.<system>.phenix-conductor`;
- `packages.<system>.phenix-harness`;
- `packages.<system>.phenix`;
- `phenixPlugins.<system>.*`;
- `wrappers.phenix.wrap`;
- `lib.mkPhenixPlugin`;
- `lib.mkPhenix`.

## Protocol and provider boundaries

The conductor wire remains internal. Protocol adapters translate external protocols to configured runtime services without owning durable application state.

Backend adapters translate execution requests into provider protocols. Provider conversation state is disposable. Durable Phenix state stays with the owning plugins.

Authentication and provider selection are plugin and Harness concerns. They must not become privileged core APIs or ambient process authority.

## Design rules

- Keep one canonical typed API per semantic operation.
- Keep one durable owner per semantic domain.
- Parse external data at boundaries and keep invalid runtime states difficult to represent internally.
- Preserve typed failure modes across configuration, transport, protocol, plugin, and provider boundaries.
- Effective authority is the intersection of caller authority, provider maximum authority, and invocation restrictions.
- Apply the same authority attenuation to direct calls, plugin calls, retries, events, tasks, persistence, workspace operations, and external plugins.
- Resource-only plugins cannot execute code.
- Zero-plugin mode has no hidden first-party fallbacks.
- First-party plugins use the same contracts as alternate plugins.
- Do not add parallel frontend-to-agent protocols or duplicate orchestration registries.
- Keep frontend-specific behavior and packaging in frontend repositories.
- Tests should assert behavior, protocol semantics, or cross-boundary integration rather than duplicated configuration facts.

## Development

```sh
nix develop
maintenance fix
maintenance all
```

Validation is separated into source, Rust, integration/system, realized product, Nix composition, and Maintenance boundaries. Product validation exercises installed conductor and Harness compositions. Frontend behavior is tested in frontend repositories.

See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for focused validation commands and test-boundary guidance.
