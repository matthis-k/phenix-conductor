## Purpose

Define the kernel and `PluginHost` concurrency boundary without constraining a Plugin's private implementation.

The canonical Plugin API is synchronous and message-oriented. Core does not require an async executor. A Plugin or Runtime Provider may use async internally, but executor-specific types do not cross the Plugin API.

## Boundary rule

Kernel, `PluginHost`, Interface metadata, cross-Plugin dispatch, and Runtime Provider contracts do not require:

- `Future` or async `Stream` as ABI types;
- Tokio, async-std, or another executor as a Core dependency;
- async mutexes or channels as required kernel mechanisms;
- executor-aware lifecycle or cancellation semantics.

`PluginInstance` lifecycle and invocation callbacks are synchronous. A caller may legitimately wait for short work to complete inline.

Long blocking work is explicit. Plugin code that must wait without stalling unrelated kernel work uses the kernel-owned task scope exposed by `PluginHost` or an equivalent bounded worker owned by a Runtime Provider. Core does not silently move every Plugin invocation onto a hidden executor or worker pool.

## Rust authoring versus Plugin API

Rust authoring syntax and the Plugin API are separate concerns.

A Rust Plugin may use ordinary synchronous methods. A Plugin implementation may also use `async fn` internally when its dependencies or private design justify it.

If the authoring SDK accepts an async handler, generated or generic plumbing adapts it behind the synchronous Plugin API boundary. No `Future`, executor handle, or async stream becomes part of Interface metadata, cross-Plugin dispatch, Runtime Provider protocol, lifecycle semantics, or cancellation semantics.

Private implementations may own an executor. For example, the Provider SDK may block its synchronous Plugin callback on a private Tokio runtime. That executor remains an implementation detail of that Plugin crate.

Canonical examples should prefer synchronous handlers when async behavior is not relevant.

## Concurrency model

```text
short kernel or Plugin operation
  -> synchronous call

long or blocking Plugin work
  -> PluginHost task scope or Runtime Provider worker
  -> dedicated thread or bounded blocking worker pool
  -> typed result or Interface message

CPU-bound parallel work
  -> ordinary CPU pool or Rayon when justified
```

The kernel task scope pins:

- owning Plugin when spawned through `PluginHost`;
- Graph Generation;
- attenuated authority;
- explicit cancellation state.

Do not use a CPU work-stealing pool as the normal home for long-lived blocking network, subprocess, authentication, or Plugin I/O.

## Streaming

Streaming is a sequence of typed userspace messages, not an async ABI type.

Model output, subprocess output, ACP traffic, and similar product behavior define their own correlated event or message contracts. Core transports normal typed values and provenance; it does not define a universal async stream primitive.

## Cancellation

Cancellation is explicit and observable.

A synchronous Plugin invocation receives a kernel-owned live-call cancellation token through `PluginHost`. A spawned kernel task receives its own cancellation token carrying the task's Graph Generation and attenuated authority.

Stopping or replacing a Plugin generation cancels its matching live calls and owned tasks. After a Plugin callback returns, kernel dispatch checks the live-call token before accepting the result. A result returned after cancellation is rejected as a cancelled invocation rather than entering canonical state.

Task cancellation uses an atomic cancellation flag and emits the ordinary kernel task-cancelled event. Cancellation does not depend on dropping a `Future`.

Userspace Interfaces may define additional domain cancellation behavior.

## Blocking operations and locks

A blocked worker must not retain broad kernel mutable-state locks or kernel persistence transactions unless that exact critical section requires it.

`TaskRuntime` workers receive cloned task state and communicate through explicit result channels. The kernel does not hold the Plugin instance lock while a task-scope worker waits. Unrelated kernel transitions therefore remain able to progress while such a worker is blocked.

Embedded native Plugin code remains trusted in-process code. Core cannot prevent arbitrary native code from blocking its own caller thread or taking private locks. Long blocking work that must not stall the caller must use the explicit task/worker boundary.

## Runtime Providers

Runtime Providers expose the same synchronous Plugin API to Core and may use any private concurrency implementation behind it.

A Runtime Provider may translate cancellation into a correlated guest request, process termination, socket closure, or another runtime-specific mechanism. Executor types remain private to the bridge.

Process-backed runtime behavior, transport correlation, and isolation are owned by `spec/plugin-process-runtime-bridge.md`; those additive features are not prerequisites for the executor-independent Core contract.

## Dependency policy

Core and `PluginHost` use blocking-native standard synchronization and do not depend on Tokio or another async runtime.

A Plugin, Provider implementation, adapter, or Runtime Provider may depend on an async executor when its private implementation requires one. That dependency must not escape into canonical Plugin contracts.

## Invariants

- Kernel and Plugin API contracts are synchronous and message-oriented.
- Core requires no async executor.
- Plugin-private async implementation is allowed without changing the Plugin API.
- Long blocking work that must not stall unrelated kernel progress uses an explicit task or worker boundary.
- Streaming uses typed userspace messages rather than async ABI types.
- Cancellation is explicit and observable.
- Late results from cancelled live-call scopes are rejected.
- Task authority and Graph Generation are pinned when work is spawned.
- CPU work and blocking I/O use appropriate scheduling mechanisms.
- Runtime Provider bridges expose no executor-specific types through the canonical Plugin API.

## Regression coverage

The repository verifies that:

- task cancellation is explicit, authority-attenuated, and Graph Generation-scoped;
- live-call cancellation is owner- and generation-scoped;
- service dispatch rejects a result after its live-call token is cancelled;
- Runtime Provider hosts receive the same explicit cancellation boundary;
- a blocked `PluginHost` task does not prevent an unrelated kernel transition;
- Rust authoring may adapt private async handlers behind the synchronous Plugin API;
- the Provider SDK may use a private Tokio runtime without exposing it through Plugin contracts.

## Component invocation and state ownership

`PluginId` remains the authority, lifecycle, resource-ownership, and replacement boundary. Component calls within one Plugin use the same kernel dispatch path as calls between Plugins.

1. Core tracks active component and service endpoints inside the generation-pinned invocation. A call may revisit one Plugin through a distinct endpoint. Repeating an active endpoint fails before handler state is acquired.

2. Generated static Plugins expose immutable dispatch through `SharedPluginInvocation`. Mutable domain state uses explicit synchronization handles with scopes chosen by the Plugin author. The generated adapter does not hold the Plugin instance lock across a handler or outbound call.

3. Export, Layer, and Listener handlers use shared receivers. The macros reject an exported mutable receiver with a diagnostic that directs the author to an explicit synchronization handle. Start and stop retain exclusive mutable access after live shared references have quiesced.

4. Every outbound interface call retains component resolution, Layers, authority attenuation, generation pinning, cancellation, and provenance. Packaging two components in one Plugin does not add a direct-call path around those checks.

5. The Plugin ABI remains synchronous and executor-independent. Generated async handlers synchronously await completion. Long work uses the kernel task boundary and correlated completion.

The repository verifies that:

- typed imports traverse distinct components owned by one Plugin;
- a causal call may revisit that Plugin through a distinct endpoint;
- repeated component endpoints fail without hanging;
- legacy mutable Plugin dispatch rejects causal re-entry before attempting to reacquire the instance lock;
- first-party Plugins use explicit interior state where handlers mutate data;
- the existing task, authority, Layer, generation, and provenance regressions run through the same dispatch path.
