# Rust library ownership audit

Status: reference audit, not an implementation specification.

Audit snapshot: `main` at `67c46f292ae66461f9aac63753c3532aa1043ab8`.

This audit applies the repository rule that Phenix should own semantics, not generic Rust mechanics. Current code and deterministic tests remain authoritative when this document becomes stale.

## Decision rule

Use this order when adding or reviewing a Rust abstraction:

1. Use an upstream type directly when its semantics match.
2. Add a local extension trait when the upstream type is semantically correct but lacks Phenix-specific ergonomics.
3. Use a derive, proc-macro, or helper crate for mechanical behavior.
4. Keep a transparent Phenix newtype only when nominal identity or an invariant matters.
5. Write a Phenix-owned datatype, macro, algorithm, or state machine only when existing crates cannot express the required semantics cleanly.

A wrapper that contains exactly one upstream type and only adds convenience methods should normally become an extension trait. A type that changes which values are valid, prevents distinct concepts from being mixed, or defines a Phenix protocol/domain state remains a Phenix type.

## Recommended crate set

| Concern | Prefer | Phenix ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validated IDs and strings | `nutype` | Names and validation rules |
| Error implementations | `thiserror` | Error taxonomy and messages |
| Builders | `bon` | Required semantic fields |
| Simple conversions/formatting | `derive_more` | Semantic conversions only |
| Enum strings/iteration | `strum` | Variant meaning |
| Closed enum sets | `enumset` | Feature meaning |
| Secrets | `secrecy` | Credential policy and persistence boundary |
| HTTP primitives | `http`, `bytes` | Provider policy and interpretation |
| Graph algorithms | `petgraph` | Node/edge meaning, provider and authority policy |
| Cancellation | `tokio-util::sync::CancellationToken` | Propagation policy |
| Synchronous locking | `parking_lot` | State invariants |
| Non-empty collections | `vec1` or equivalent | Why emptiness is invalid |
| Relative paths | `relative-path` where wire/config paths are relative | Path meaning |
| Proc-macro attributes | `darling` + `syn` | Phenix DSL semantics and generated ABI |
| Proc-macro crate lookup | `proc-macro-crate` | None |
| Proc-macro UI tests | `trybuild` | Expected diagnostics |
| Serde boundary diagnostics | `serde_path_to_error`, `serde_with` | Domain parsing rules |
| SQLite migration bookkeeping | `rusqlite_migration` where compatible | Schema and migration semantics |
| MCP | official `rmcp` | Callable mapping, authority, lifecycle |
| ACP | official ACP SDK | Phenix mapping and application semantics |
| OAuth | `oauth2` and standard HTTP/JWT helpers | Provider config, credential UX and policy |

## File audit

Verdicts:

- **Yes, appropriate Phenix type**: the type carries real Phenix semantics and should remain owned by Phenix.
- **Keep type, replace mechanics**: nominal identity/invariant matters, but derives/library types should replace hand-written mechanics.
- **Replace + extension trait**: use the upstream representation directly and add Phenix-specific ergonomic behavior through a trait if useful.
- **Replace**: the local abstraction is generic infrastructure with no useful Phenix ownership.

| File | Existing definitions or mechanics | Verdict | Recommended change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rust/crates/phenix-core/src/identity.rs` | Many string ID newtypes, `InterfaceId`, local ID macro, manual serde/format/parse/codec | Keep type, replace mechanics | Retain nominal IDs. Replace ID macro and ordinary impls with `nutype`; keep only special validators and Phenix codec integration. |
| `rust/crates/phenix-domain/src/lib.rs` | Second domain-ID macro; session/execution/model/orchestration DTOs; secret strings | Mixed | DTOs are **Yes, appropriate Phenix type**.

| `rust/crates/phenix-core/src/artifact.rs` | `ArtifactRevision(String)`, SHA-256 parsing/formatting/error | Keep type, replace mechanics | Keep content-revision semantics. Delegate validated representation, digest encoding, derives, and error mechanics. |
| `rust/crates/phenix-core/src/authority.rs` | `Authority` over open capability IDs | **Yes, appropriate Phenix type** | Keep. Open capability namespaces should not become a closed bitset. |

| `rust/crates/phenix-backend-native/src/credentials.rs` | JSON credential store, XDG discovery, permissions/atomic replacement, raw secrets | **Replace heavily** | Prefer standard credential/keyring facilities.

## LOC estimate

This is a planning estimate, not a measured diff.

| Area | Removed | Replacement glue | Net |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MCP, OAuth and provider protocol mechanics | 700-1,100 | 250-500 | -450 to -700 |
| IDs, validated strings and invariant wrappers | 700-1,100 | 200-350 | -500 to -750 |
| Manual error implementations | 400-700 | 100-200 | -300 to -500 |
| Duplicate option/domain definitions | 250-450 | 20-80 | -230 to -370 |
| Generic graph algorithms | 250-450 | 100-180 | -150 to -270 |
| Cancellation/task mechanics | 150-300 | 40-100 | -110 to -200 |
| HTTP/header/bytes wrappers | 200-350 | 70-140 | -130 to -210 |
| Proc-macro parsing infrastructure | 400-800 | 200-400 | -200 to -400 |
| Binding/code-generation plumbing | 250-500 | 150-300 | -100 to -200 |
| Builders, lock boilerplate and misc invariants | 200-400 | 80-180 | -120 to -220 |
| **Total** | **3,500-6,150** | **1,200-2,400** | **about -2,300 to -3,750** |

Use about **3,000 fewer hand-maintained Rust LOC** as the planning midpoint. Generated provider wire models can increase raw repository LOC while still reducing human-maintained code.

## Implementation guardrails

Do not flatten semantic types merely to reduce LOC. Preserve Phenix-owned types for authority, capability semantics, plugin/component contracts, execution/session state, observable transaction semantics, provider selection, application descriptors and structural compatibility.

Do not add a wrapper when an upstream type plus an extension trait is enough. Examples include `HeaderMap` plus a Phenix rate-limit interpretation trait, a `petgraph` graph plus Phenix dependency/provider query traits, and `CancellationToken` plus Phenix propagation helpers.

When migrating a type to a crate, preserve wire format, deterministic ordering, validation behavior, public error contracts and redaction. Library adoption is not justification for compatibility fallbacks or parallel APIs.
